This is a Django app that was generated by running
`paster create -t openblock openrural`.
It starts as a thin wrapper around ebpub, and like any such django app
it may be customized by adding templates, modifying urls.py, etc.

For more documentation, see
http://openblockproject.org/docs/install/custom.html

For deployment with apache's mod_wsgi, there is a suitable wsgi script
in the wsgi/ directory.

There are more example config files in etc/.
